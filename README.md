# Automated Attendance System Using Face Recognition

## Problem Definition
Manual attendance marking in a class is a bit burdensome due to a wide
number of students present in a class and maybe a chance of proxy
attendance.
So building a face recognition based attendance system which can manage
the records of the students will be more efficient, advantageous also time
saving and secured.

## Overview 
This is a graduation project where the objective of the system is to collect the attendance of the students during the lecture in an automated way using face recognition and saved to the system. There is an instructor dashboard so that he can view the total number of attended students during the lecture for every group, their names, their feedback from the lecture using machine learning and deep learning. Also, dashboard for student that allows the student to check his attendance for all lectures and receiving a notification upon attending the lecture to make sure that he was attended successfully.

## Goals
- **Time Saving:** You can capture the attendance of the students in the class with a button click however their number.

- **Prevent Proxy Attendance:** There is no chance that a student register his friend as a an attendee.

- **Lesson Understanding:** You can keep track of the students feedback and satisfaction during the lecture *[future work]*

## Conclusion
In conclusion, an automated face recognition attendance system is a great way
to streamline the process of taking attendance in any organization, specifically in
the educational systems. It is reliable, accurate, and cost-effective. It also
provides an extra layer of security and can help reduce time spent on manual
processes
